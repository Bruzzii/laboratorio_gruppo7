# The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats.

Once upon a time there was an old goat who had seven little goats, and she loved them as a mother loves her babies. One day she thought of going into the woods to get provisions for the evening meal; she called them all seven and said, "***Dear little ones, I want to go into the woods; beware of the wolf; if he comes, he will eat you all in one bite. That rascal often disguises himself, but you will recognize him at once by his hoarse voice and black paws. "*** The little goats said, "***Dear mother, we will be very careful, you may go peacefully. "*** The old woman bleated and confidently set off.
Soon after, there was a knock at the door, shouting, "***Open up, dear little ones; here is your mommy, who has brought you a present for each. "*** But, from the hoarse voice, the little goats knew it was the wolf. "***Let's not open it, "*** they said, "***you are not our mommy; mommy has a sweet little voice, yours is hoarse; you are the wolf. "*** Then the wolf went to a shopkeeper and bought a big piece of clay; he ate it and so softened his voice. Then he came back, knocked on the door and shouted, "***Open up, dear little ones, there is your mommy, who has brought you a present for each one. "*** But he had leaned his black paw against the window; the little ones saw it and shouted, "***Don't open it; our mommy doesn't have black paws like you: you are the wolf. "*** Then the wolf ran to a baker and said, "***I hurt my foot, spread some paste on it. "***And when the baker had smeared his paw, he ran to the miller and said, "***Spread some white flour on my paw. "*** The miller thought, The wolf wants to deceive someone, and he refused; but the wolf said, "***If you don't, I'll eat you. "*** Then the miller was afraid and whitewashed his paw. Yeah, that's what men do.
Now the rascal went for the third time to the doorway, knocked and said, "***Open me, little ones; your dear mommy has come back from the woods and brought you each a present. "*** The little goats shouted, "***First show us your paw, for we know if you are our dear mommy. "*** Then the wolf put the paw on the window, and when they saw that it was white they believed all true what he said and opened the door. But it was the wolf who entered. The kids were frightened and tried to hide. The first one jumped under the table, the second in the bed, the third in the stove, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the closet, the sixth under the sink, and the seventh in the pendulum clock case. But the wolf found them all and made no compliments: he swallowed them one after another; but the last one, inside the clock case, he did not find. When the urge was gone, the wolf left, lay down under a tree on the green meadow and went to sleep.

A little later the old goat returned from the woods. Ah, what did she have to see! The door of the house was wide open, table chairs and benches were overturned, the sink was in pieces, blanket and pillows torn from the bed. She looked for her little ones, but could not find them anywhere. He called them by name, one after another, but no one answered. Finally, when she called her youngest, a little voice cried out, "Dear Mom, I'm hiding in the clock case." She pulled him out and he told her that the wolf had come and devoured all the others. Think how she wept for her poor little ones!
Finally she went out all distressed and the smallest goat ran out with her. When she arrived in the meadow, here was the wolf lying under the tree, and he was snoring so much that the branches were shaking. She looked at it from all sides and noticed that in its bulging belly something was moving and wiggling. "Ah, my God," he thought, "are my poor little ones still alive, whom the wolf devoured for dinner?" He told the kid to run home and get scissors, needle and thread. Then he cut the monster's belly; and at the first cut, one kid put out its head, then as he cut, all six jumped out and they were all alive and well; for the monster out of greed had swallowed them whole. What joy was that! They clung to their dear mother and jumped contentedly like pasque. But the old woman said, "Go now; and find some stones to fill this damned one's belly before he rises." Then the seven little goats dragged the stones in great haste, and cast into that belly as many as they could carry. Then the old woman sewed it up in a flash, so that the wolf did not notice and did not even move.
At last, when he had had a good night's sleep, the wolf got up, and because the stones in his stomach gave him a great thirst, he wanted to go to a fountain. But when he began to move, the stones clattered in his belly with great noise. Then he cried out:
"Rumble and rumble.

In my belly I thought they were
Six little goats, they are stoners
Nice and good.___"
And when he came to the fountain and bent over the water to drink, the weight of the stones pulled him down, and he was miserably drowned. At that sight the seven kids came running, shouting: ___"The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!___" And with their mother they danced with joy around the fountain.
