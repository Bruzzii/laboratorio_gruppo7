# The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids

Once upon a time, there was an old goat who had seven little kids, and she loved them as a mother loves her children. One day, she thought of going into the woods to gather some food for dinner; she called all seven of them and said: "***Dear little ones, I want to go to the woods; beware of the wolf; if he comes, he will gobble you all up in one bite. That scoundrel often disguises himself, but you'll recognize him immediately by his hoarse voice and black paws."*** The little kids said: "***Dear mother, we'll be very careful, you can go without worry."*** The old goat bleated and set off confidently.

Shortly after, someone knocked on the door, shouting: "***Open up, dear little ones; your mother is here, she has brought a gift for each of you."*** But, from the hoarse voice, the little kids understood that it was the wolf. "***We won't open,"*** they said, "***you're not our mother; our mother has a sweet voice, yours is hoarse; you're the wolf."*** Then the wolf went to a shopkeeper and bought a large piece of clay; he ate it and thus softened his voice. Then he returned, knocked on the door, and shouted: "***Open up, dear little ones, your mother is here, she has brought a gift for each of you."*** But he had placed his black paw on the windowsill; the kids saw it and shouted: "***We won't open; our mother doesn't have black paws like you: you're the wolf."***

Then the wolf ran to a baker and said to him: "***I hurt my foot, spread some dough over it."*** And when the baker had spread dough over his paw, he ran to the miller and said: "***Sprinkle some white flour over my paw."*** The miller thought: The wolf wants to deceive someone, and refused; but the wolf said: "***If you don't, I'll eat you."*** So the miller got scared and whitened his paw. Yes, that's what people do.
Now the rascal went to the door for the third time, knocked, and said: "***Open up, little ones; your dear mommy has returned from the woods and has brought a gift for each of you."*** The little kids shouted: "***First show us your paw, so we know if you're our dear mommy."***

Then the wolf put his paw on the windowsill, and when they saw that it was white, they believed everything he said and opened the door. But it was the wolf who entered. The kids got scared and tried to hide. The first one jumped under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the grandfather clock. But the wolf found them all and didn't hesitate: he swallowed them one after the other; but the last one, inside the grandfather clock, he couldn't find. When he had his fill, the wolf went away, lay down under a tree on the green grass, and fell asleep.

Shortly after, the old goat returned from the woods. Ah, what she saw! The door of the house was wide open, table, chairs, and benches were overturned, the sink was broken, blankets and pillows torn from the bed. She searched for her little ones, but couldn't find them anywhere. She called them by name, one after the other, but no one answered. Finally, when she called the youngest, a tiny voice shouted: "***Dear mommy, I'm hiding in the grandfather clock."*** She pulled him out, and he told her that the wolf had come and eaten all the others.

Think of how she cried for her poor little ones!
In the end, she went out all distressed and the smallest kid ran out with her. When they arrived in the meadow, there was the wolf lying under the tree, snoring so loudly that the branches trembled. She observed him from all sides and noticed that something was moving and wriggling in his swollen belly. "***Oh, my God,"*** she thought, "***are my poor little ones still alive, whom the wolf devoured for dinner?"***

She told the little kid to run home and fetch scissors, needle, and thread. Then she cut open the monster's belly; and with the first cut, a kid stuck out its head, then, as she kept cutting, all six of them jumped out, and they were all alive and well; because the monster, in his greed, had swallowed them whole. What a joy that was! They hugged their dear mother and hopped around happily like Easter bunnies. But the old goat said: "***Go now, and find some stones to fill this cursed one's belly before he wakes up."***

So the seven little kids hurriedly dragged stones and stuffed as many as they could carry into the belly. Then the old goat sewed it up in a flash, so the wolf didn't notice and didn't even stir.
Finally, when he had a good nap, the wolf got up, and because the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a fountain. But as he began to move, the stones started clashing in his belly with a loud noise.

Then he cried out:
"***Rumble and tumble In my belly, I thought they were Six little kids, they're big stones Pretty and good."***
And when he reached the fountain and leaned over to drink, the weight of the stones pulled him down, and he miserably drowned. At that sight, the seven little kids came running, shouting: "***The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!"*** And with their mother, they danced for joy around the fountain.
