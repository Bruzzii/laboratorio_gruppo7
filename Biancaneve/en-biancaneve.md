# Snow White

Once upon a time, there was Snow White, a princess who lived with her father the King and a stepmother as beautiful as she was wicked.

Grimhilde, Snow White's stepmother, had managed to marry the King because she was actually a witch, and she had cast a spell on him.

From that day on, everything in the castle became sadder. Grimhilde demanded to be served and revered in everything, and she made sure that Snow White was considered little more than a mere servant. But Snow White endured even the worst rudenesses because, to be happy again, all she had to do was remember her dear mother who was no longer there.

Grimhilde also had a magic mirror that could answer all her questions, but she only asked one:
***"Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"*** – she asked every morning upon waking up.
And the mirror, which was a serious magic mirror, would answer her truthfully.
***"My lady, you are the fairest of them all."***
And Grimhilde would smile wickedly...

But Snow White grew more beautiful every day, and Grimhilde was envious, so she made her do the humblest tasks, hoping she would become less beautiful than her.

Until one day, after Grimhilde's usual question, the mirror replied:
***"My lady, Snow White is the fairest of them all..."***
Grimhilde began to scream furiously and almost broke the mirror in her anger.
That night she couldn't close her eyes, and she thought of a plan to make Snow White disappear, so she could remain the fairest in the land.

In the morning, she called the huntsman, her servant, and ordered him to take Snow White into the forest and bring back her heart as proof of her death.
The poor huntsman reluctantly obeyed.

***"Where are you taking me, Mr. Huntsman?"*** – Snow White asked, but the huntsman remained silent, with his eyes downcast.
When they were finally deep in the forest, they stopped. The huntsman was supposed to take out his rifle, but he loved Snow White too much to harm her.
***"What's wrong, Mr. Huntsman?"*** – Snow White asked?
***"Grimhilde wants to be the fairest in the land, so she ordered me to bring you here to the forest and..."***

But the huntsman couldn't finish the sentence. He thought leaving the girl alone in the forest would be enough, and the wolves would take care of the rest.
He bid Snow White farewell with a wave of his hand, tears in his eyes, and ran away.

Snow White, who still hadn't quite understood what had happened and why she had been brought there, began to look around fearfully. She had never been alone in the deep forest before.
She started running left and right, unable to find the path back to the castle, until she stumbled upon a small cottage.

Frightened and tired, she knocked on the door, but no one answered. She slowly pushed the door, asking for permission, but no one responded.
She found herself inside a tiny kitchen, with a small table and seven tiny chairs all around.
On the table, there was bread and water. Snow White took a little to ease her hunger and thirst, and then she began to explore the cottage.

She found herself in a bedroom with seven small beds. She was truly amazed and sat down on one of them, but she fell asleep due to exhaustion.

She was awakened by a great noise coming from the kitchen. It was already evening, and voices of men wondering who had entered their house were coming from the other room.
So, Snow White ran into the kitchen.
***"And who are you?!"*** – exclaimed the seven little dwarfs when they saw her coming.
***"I am Snow White, please forgive me for entering your house without permission but..."*** – and Snow White told them her whole sad story.

When she finished, the seven dwarfs looked at each other and unanimously declared:
***"Do not worry, Snow White, stay at our house, you are welcome. We will offer you shelter and protection from the wicked stepmother."***
***"Thank you, my dear dwarfs,"*** – said Snow White – ***"I will repay your kindness, do not doubt!"*** – and she immediately started preparing dinner and tidying up the house.
The seven dwarfs, named Grumpy, Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy, and Happy, could not have been happier.

The next day Grimhilde woke up all happy, thinking she had gotten rid of Snow White, and asked her mirror:
***"Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"***
But the mirror replied: ***"My lady, it is Snow White who is the fairest of them all, and now she lives in the forest with seven little dwarfs."***

***"It can't be!"*** – screamed Grimhilde – ***"I had her taken to the forest by the huntsman, look, this is her heart!"*** – and she showed a wooden casket.
***"That in the casket is the heart of a goat!"*** – the mirror replied.
Grimhilde screamed furiously at the mirror and the unfaithful huntsman, and decided that she would personally resolve the matter.
She rushed to the dungeons of the castle where she hid her laboratory of magic potions and started brewing spells.

Meanwhile, Snow White was all happy that the seven dwarfs had welcomed her like a sister. While they went to work in the nearby mine during the day, she prepared lunch, tidied up the house, and washed the clothes.
And in the evening, they had a lot of fun telling stories and rhymes.

But one day, an old lady with white hair and dressed in rags knocked on the door.
***"Good morning, dear old lady, what can I do for you?"***
***"Good morning, my dear girl, I am a poor old woman selling apples, would you like one?"*** – said the old lady.
***"Your red apples are beautiful, but I have no money to pay you..."*** – replied Snow White.

The old lady smiled and said:
***"You are so beautiful, my young girl, that I'll give you one, here, eat it."***
Snow White took the apple and brought it to her mouth...
But as soon as she took a bite, Snow White fell unconscious to the ground!

The old lady then started laughing, laughing, and laughing, and shortly after, she transformed into Grimhilde who had disguised herself as an old woman and had poisoned the apple.
So, as Grimhilde disappeared into the forest, Snow White lay on the ground as if dead.
That evening, the seven dwarfs returned home, and seeing her like that, they despaired and cried all night.

The next day, they didn't have the heart to bury her as she was still so beautiful, so they prepared a crystal coffin for her and placed it in a small glade. They left her there in the company of squirrels and birds, crying as they walked away.

Towards evening, the prince of the neighboring kingdom, Florian, passed by on his way home from a hunting trip.
Intrigued by the crystal coffin with a girl inside, he approached, and when he saw Snow White's beauty, he immediately fell in love with her.

He didn't know that Snow White had been poisoned by Grimhilde and thought she was only resting in a deep sleep.
So, he took her in his arms. But just then, the small piece of poisoned apple that Snow White still had in her mouth fell to the ground.
Prince Florian kissed her, and Snow White, who no longer had the poison in her mouth, gradually regained consciousness.
Florian was also a handsome young man, and Snow White was happy to find herself in his arms again.
