# Little Red Riding Hood
Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl; everyone loved her at first sight, especially her grandmother who didn't know what else to give her as a gift. One day she gave her a red velvet hood, and since it suited her so well, and she didn't want to wear anything else, they always called her Little Red Riding Hood.

One day her mother said to her:
"___Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of focaccia and a bottle of wine, take them to your grandmother; she is weak and sick and will be refreshed.
Be kind, greet her for me, and go straight without straying from the path, otherwise you might fall, break the bottle, and leave your grandmother empty-handed."___
"___Yes, I will do everything properly,"___ Little Red Riding Hood promised her mother, and took her hand.

But the grandmother lived outside, in the woods, half an hour from the village. When Little Red Riding Hood entered the woods, she met the wolf, but she didn't know it was such a wicked beast and wasn't afraid.
"___Good morning, Little Red Riding Hood,"___ it said. "___Thank you, wolf."___ - "___Where are you going so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"___ - "___To grandmother's house."___ - "___What do you have under your apron?"___ - "___Wine and focaccia for my weak and old grandmother; we baked bread yesterday, so it will strengthen her!"___ - "___Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"___ - "___About a quarter of an hour from here, in the woods, under the three big oaks; her house is beneath the hazel bushes, you probably know it,"___ Little Red Riding Hood said.

The wolf thought to himself: this tender little girl is a good delicious morsel for you, you must find a way to catch her. It walked a little way with Little Red Riding Hood, then said: "___Look at all the beautiful flowers in the woods, Little Red Riding Hood; why don't you look around? I bet you don't even hear the sweet singing of the birds! You're so serious as if you were going to school, and it's so cheerful in the woods!"___
Little Red Riding Hood looked up and when she saw the sun rays filtering through the trees, and all around full of beautiful flowers, she thought: If I bring grandmother a bouquet of flowers, she'll be pleased; it's still early enough for me to arrive on time. And she ran into the woods in search of flowers. And when she had picked one, she thought there might be an even more beautiful one further ahead, so she ran there and thus ventured deeper into the woods.

Meanwhile, the wolf went straight to grandmother's house and knocked on the door. "___Who is it?"___ - "___Little Red Riding Hood, I bring you wine and focaccia; open up."___ - "___Just lift the latch,"___ the grandmother shouted, "___I'm too weak to get up."___ The wolf lifted the latch, entered, and without saying a word went straight to the grandmother's bed and swallowed her. Then it put on her clothes and cap, lay down in bed, and drew the curtains.

But Little Red Riding Hood had wandered off in search of flowers, and when she had collected so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother and set off to visit her. When she arrived, she was surprised to find the door wide open, and upon entering the room she had such a strange feeling that she thought: "___Oh my, how scared I am today! and to think that I usually enjoy being with grandmother so much!"___

So she approached the bed and drew back the curtains: the grandmother was lying with the cap pulled down over her face, and looked strange. "___Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!"___ - "___To hear you better."___ - "___Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!"___ - "___To see you better."___ - "___Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!"___ - "___To grab you better."___ - "___But, grandmother, what a frightening mouth you have!"___ - "___To devour you better!"___ And as soon as it had said these words, the wolf jumped out of bed and swallowed poor Little Red Riding Hood.

Then, with a full belly, it got back into bed, fell asleep, and started snoring loudly. Just then the hunter passed by and thought to himself: "___How loudly the old lady snores! I should check on her if she needs anything."___ He entered the room and approached the bed, where he saw the wolf he had been looking for. He was about to aim his gun when it occurred to him that perhaps the wolf had swallowed the grandmother and that he could still save her.

So he didn't shoot, but instead took a pair of scissors and cut open the sleeping wolf's belly. After two cuts he saw Little Red Riding Hood's hood shining, and after a few more, the girl jumped out shouting: "___How scared I was! It was so dark inside the wolf's belly!"___ Then the grandmother also emerged, still alive.

And Little Red Riding Hood went to collect some big stones with which they filled the wolf's belly; when it woke up it tried to run away, but the stones were so heavy that it immediately fell to the ground and died.

They were all happy: the hunter took the wolf's skin, the grandmother ate the focaccia and drank the wine Little Red Riding Hood had brought; and Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself: "___You will never run alone in the woods, away from the path, when mother has forbidden it."___
